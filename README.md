# Customer Segmentation & Product Profitability Analysis  

## Project Overview  

This project aims to assist the (hypothetical) marketing department in identifying the most profitable customer segments and best-selling products. By analyzing transaction data, we extract insights about customer characteristics‚Äîsuch as marital status, employment, and purchasing behavior‚Äîand determine the top three most profitable products.  

## **Expected Deliverables**  

1. **Jupyter Notebook (or Python Script)**  
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
   - Customer segmentation analysis  
   - Profitability analysis of products  
   - Visualizations for insights  
2. **Short Summary of Findings**  
   - Characteristics of the most loyal and profitable customers  
   - Top 3 bestselling and most profitable products  
   - Hypothesis on why these customers prefer certain products  

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions  

To run this project locally, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viggu3sd/ML-HiringTask-iGnosis-Tech.git  
   cd ML-HiringTask-iGnosis-Tech  
   ```  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```  
3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook  
   ```  
   OR  
   ```bash
   python analysis.py  
   ```  

##  Working of the Code  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loads transaction data and cleans missing values.  
   - Converts categorical variables into numerical formats.  
   - Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  

2. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Identifies key characteristics of loyal and profitable customers.  
   - Segments customers based on purchasing behavior and demographics.  
   - Analyzes factors like marital status, employment, and spending habits.  

3. **Product Profitability Analysis**  
   - Computes revenue and profit for each product.  
   - Identifies the top 3 most profitable products.  
   - Visualizes trends in purchasing behavior.  

4. **Hypothesis & Insights**  
   - Discusses why certain customers are more loyal.  
   - Explains why specific products are bestsellers.  
   - Suggests marketing strategies based on findings.  

## Results  

- **Top 3 Most Profitable Products**: Identified from transaction data.  
- **Most Loyal Customers**: Segmented based on purchasing patterns.  
- **Hypothesis**: Explanation of customer preferences and spending behavior.
